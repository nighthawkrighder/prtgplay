# v11.4.1 - Click Detection Refinements

## Changes
- 🎯 **Auto Zoom-Out Distance**: Increased from 200 to 600 units for reliable ship selection
- 🖱️ **Mouse Jitter Tolerance**: Doubled to 10x at close range (up from 5x) - allows 50px movement at 100 units

## Impact
Ships now clickable without manual zoom-out. More forgiving for hand movement when inspecting close-up.
